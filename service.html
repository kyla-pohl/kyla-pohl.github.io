<h2>Service</h2> 
<p>
    Mathematicians carry the responsiblity of making sure that all feel welcome in their community 
    as well as communicating their work with each other and the wider world.
</p>
<p>
    Some of my current service work to these ends is below, but please see my <a href="pohl-cv.html">CV</a> for a more complete listing of these endeavors.

<h3>
    Association for Women in Mathematics
</h3>
<p>
    I am the co-president of the <a href="https://pages.uoregon.edu/uoawm/">UO's graduate student chapter</a> of the Association for Women in Mathematics.
</p>
<p>
    Our chapter's goal is to create a community in which women and girls can thrive in their mathematical endeavors, and to promote equitable opportunity and treatment of women and others of marginalized genders and gender identities across the mathematical sciences.
    Our projects include inviting high-profile women in mathematics to UO to give seminar talks, holding professional and social enrichment events, managing a library of books about the experiences of marginalized individuals in mathematics, and encouraging children in the Eugene/Springfield community to learn about STEM topics.
</p>
<p>
    I am a member of the <a href="https://pages.uoregon.edu/uoawm/outreach.html">K-12 Outreach committee</a> and I co-chair the <a href="https://pages.uoregon.edu/uoawm/library.html">Reading Room committee</a>.

<h3>
    Directed Reading Program
</h3>
<p>
    For the last three years, I have mentored reading projects with undergraduate math majors through the UO math department's <a href="https://blogs.uoregon.edu/uomathdrp/">Directed Reading Program</a>.
    I have lead projects on 
    <ul>
        <li>
            introductory graph theory and Ramsey theory,
        </li>
        <li>
            poset theory, and 
        </li>
        <li>
            intransitive dice.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Each project culminates in the student delivering a 20 minute presentation on their learning to their peers. 
    I also serve on the Directed Reading Program Organization Committee to help plan the program's events.
