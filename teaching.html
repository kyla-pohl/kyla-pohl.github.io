<h2>Teaching</h2>
<p>
    As an educator, my main focus in the classroom is humanizing the mathematical learning process through transparency. 
    I use regular assessment as a key component to measuring student progress toward course goals and fulfillment. 
    Through these techniques and others, I strive to make my classroom an equitable learning environment for all. 
    Every student who enters my classroom has the potential for conceptual mastery and academic success.
</p>
<p>
    I have four years of wide-ranging sole-instructor undergraduate mathematics teaching experience at the University of Oregon. 
    I have experience with traditional lecture classes with active learning components as well as the flipped classroom. 
    During the pandemic, I had the opportunity to gain experience teaching synchronous online classes. 
    Additionally, I have participated in the UO math department's <a
    href="https://blogs.uoregon.edu/uomathdrp/">Directed Reading Program</a> for two years and intend to participate this coming winter as well. 
    In order to enhance my skills, I'm currently working on the <a
    href="https://teaching.uoregon.edu/graduate-teaching-initiative">UO Graduate Teaching Initiative</a>'s certificate program.
    More about my philosophy and experience can be found in my <a href="Teaching_Statement-9.27.24.pdf">teaching statement</a>.

<h3>
    Selected Student Evaluations
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Foundations of Algebra and Mathematical Modeling, Fall 2023: "[...] You acknowledge when you make a mistake and acknowledge if something is confusing. Keep doing what you're doing. [...]"
    </li>
    <li>
        Foundations of Algebra and Mathematical Modeling, Fall 2023: "I like having you as a teacher will be sad to take the next math."
    </li>
    <li>
        Precalculus II, Winter 2023: "[...] Just a thank you for consistency and clarity while instructing during lecture/worksheets/Canvas announcement or discussions."
    </li>
    <li>
        Precalculus I, Winter 2021: "I really want to let you know that I appreciate everything you have done for me so far this term. I know it's pretty annoying getting emails from me almost every day asking for help, but it's really helped me understand what's going on and I think my midterm reflected that especially since I failed all my other quizzes before that. Everything you have done for me means more than you know and I am starting to get more confident in my math skills. So once again, thank you."
